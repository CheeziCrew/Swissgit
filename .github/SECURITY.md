## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within Swiss Git, please report it by sending an email to [swissgittools@gmail.com](mailto:swissgittools@gmail.com). All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.

We kindly request that you refrain from publicly disclosing the vulnerability until we have had an opportunity to address it.

Once a vulnerability report is received, we will acknowledge it within 48 hours and provide an estimated timeline for resolution. We will keep you informed of any progress or updates throughout the process.

Upon review, if the reported vulnerability is accepted, we will work diligently to implement a fix and release it in a timely manner.

If a vulnerability report is declined for any reason, we will provide a detailed explanation for our decision and welcome further discussion or clarification.

Your assistance in responsibly disclosing security vulnerabilities is greatly appreciated, and we are committed to ensuring the security and integrity of Swiss Git for all users.
